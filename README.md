### Data availability
RNAseq data was obtained from  a previously published (Beltran et al., 2016; Berger et al, 2019) clinical cohort of tissue from NEPC tumors (n = 27), benign prostate tissue (n = 66), locally advanced prostate cancer (PCA, n = 68), and mCRPC (n = 72).

The GTEx data used for the analyses described were obtained from the [GTEx Portal](https://gtexportal.org/home/) on 03/01/2015 and/or dbGaP accession number phs000424.vN.pN on 03/01/2015
